Sequence3, also known as SQ3, is an AI-powered unified inbox platform created as part of the second-year Software Development Group Project at the Informatics Institute of Technology in Sri Lanka, affiliated with the University of Westminster, developed by the CS-22 team led by Tharuka Karunanayaka with team members Hasal Dharmagunawardana, Pamindu Rashmika Hennadige, Siyath Dharmarathne, Dharani Wasundara, and Thevindu Wickramaarachchi under the supervision of Mr. Torin Wirasingha and the academic guidance of Module Leader Mr. Banuka Athuruliya, and it was designed to solve the communication challenges faced by Sri Lankan SMEs who struggle with scattered messages across Facebook, Instagram, and web chat, slow replies, inconsistent tone, missed inquiries, language mismatches, absent conversation memory, and the general chaos of handling customers across multiple platforms without structure or intelligence. The team built Sequence3 after conducting questionnaires, interviews, observations, literature reviews, and stakeholder modeling, discovering that businesses frequently lose customers because they cannot respond fast enough, cannot keep track of past conversations, cannot interpret Sinhala-English mixed messages correctly, and cannot maintain professionalism when conversations grow emotional or complex, motivating the design of a multilingual, explainable AI system that unifies messaging into one intelligent workspace. Sequence3 processes every incoming message through a multi-agent orchestration pipeline that includes intent detection, language identification, sentiment assessment, satisfaction scoring, retrieval-based reasoning, bias detection, safety enforcement, and human escalation, ensuring that the AI replies only when appropriate and always with transparency. The Satisfaction Index at the core of the platform continuously measures emotional trajectory, preventing the AI from responding when the customer becomes frustrated or upset, shifting control to a human agent alongside a complete conversation briefing. Through retrieval-augmented generation, the system answers only using verified, tenant-specific information, avoiding hallucinations and ensuring that responses are consistent, safe, and aligned with each business’s communication standards without relying on assumptions. Sequence3 supports Sinhala, English, and natural mixed-language messaging, enabling culturally accurate interpretation of common Sri Lankan conversational patterns and creating a smoother, more human-feeling interaction. The system also constructs unified customer profiles that merge identities across channels, maintaining coherence even when users switch from Instagram to Facebook Messenger or web chat, and it generates seven-day conversation summaries so staff can quickly understand past interactions without scrolling through long message histories. Sequence3 analyzes behavioral signals across conversations to create dynamic customer segments based on communication style, engagement patterns, emotional tone, and recurring intent categories, helping businesses better understand and categorize their audience. Every component is built with strict attention to ethical, legal, social, and professional requirements, following the SLEP framework with emphasis on privacy, fairness, role-based access, data minimization, explainability, human oversight, and responsible AI governance as documented throughout the project’s academic materials. The underlying system uses a three-tier architecture with a clean separation of presentation, logic, and data layers, supporting secure multi-tenancy, scalability, maintainability, and reliability for real-world usage. Although Sequence3 has not launched yet, its development journey demonstrates how a student team can combine creative engineering, academic discipline, real-world research, and ethical AI principles to design a platform that transforms fragmented social-commerce communication into a unified, emotionally aware, explainable, and human-aligned AI experience.
